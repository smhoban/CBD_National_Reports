2. Unsystematic crossing of cultivated breeds and outbred animals led to the loss of valuable genetic potential, which had a negative effect on animals’ productivity.
3. Poor infrastructure, lack of resources and the shortage of areas for forage crops and pastures do not allow breeding entities to satisfy the need for commodity farms for highly productive livestock.
4. In recent years, due to insufficient financial resources, farms have not been able to purchase breeding animals, since growing them has become unprofitable. Purchase prices for breeding products do not cover production costs.
5. The country uses the classical method and does not use a set of methods (morphological, biochemical, immunogenetic, molecular) in assessing genetic diversity.
